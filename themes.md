Some blurb, possibly an image

Should talk about arsenic biosensor

Toxoplasma Gondii
=================

The protozoan phylum Apicomplexa is arguably the most important group of parasitic pathogens responsible for human and animal disease. According to recent WHO figures, malaria (Plasmodium spp.) alone produces global morbidity and mortality figures into the hundreds-of-millions affected people each year. The encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii infection kills an estimated 15-20% of all AIDS patients. Livestock losses and the implementation of control measures for avian coccidiosis (Eimeria spp.), costs the poultry industry millions of pounds annually. Despite decades of effort, there has been little progress in the prevention and treatment of apicomplexan diseases.
